## üî∞ Features

Stelle has several features, more can be added.

- **AUTOPLAY**: Stelle will play songs based on the queue.
- **COOLDOWN**: To avoid command spamming.
- **DATABASE**: Stelle uses `Prisma` as `ORM` and `MongoDB` as database.
- **NO HANDLERS**: Stelle will do it all for you, you just have to implement it.
- **LOCALIZATION**: Stelle is able to change the locale to your liking.
- **COMMANDS**: By default, Stelle will work with `slash` and `prefix` commands.
- **AUTOCOMPLETE**: Stelle will display track results based on your search.
- **CONTROL**: Stelle provides a necessary (*that I consider*) control over the music.
